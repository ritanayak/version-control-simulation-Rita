During this assignment, I learned how to create and manage branches in Git and gained hands-on experience with resolving merge conflicts and using pull requests for collaboration. To begin, I cloned the repository to my local machine and created a new branch using git checkout -b feature/header to work on the header component. After completing the changes, I added and committed the files, then pushed the branch to GitHub. I followed a similar process to create another branch for adding a footer. Each branch allowed me to work on separate features without affecting the main codebase, which helped keep my workflow organized.

When I attempted to merge the footer branch, I encountered a merge conflict because both the header and footer changes modified the same section of the HTML file. Git highlighted the conflict, and I reviewed the sections marked with conflict indicators (<<<<, ====, >>>>). I initially tried to keep both changes, but the conflict persisted because of overlapping lines. Eventually, I resolved the conflict by removing the conflicting header section and keeping the footer code for the merge to complete successfully. This experience helped me understand how important it is to structure code cleanly to avoid unnecessary conflicts.

Next, I created a pull request from the main branch to the newly created review/main branch. In the pull request description, I documented the changes I made and noted the conflict resolution process. The pull request workflow helped simulate a real-world team review process. It reinforced the value of reviewing code before merging, as it provides an opportunity to catch mistakes, improve clarity, and ensure consistency. Even when working independently, this process helped me think about code quality, communication, and collaboration in a more structured way.
