I cloned the repository and created the project structure. First, I added the header feature and merged it successfully. After that, I added the footer feature. While merging the footer branch, I encountered a conflict with the header 
section. I initially tried to keep both the header and footer, but the merge still resulted in errors. To resolve the issue, I removed the conflicting header part.

Next, I created the review/main branch for review.
